        Quick next steps (Option A - GitHub Actions, easiest if you don't code):
        1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com (if you don't have one).
        2. Create a new repository named 'crypto-4h-signals'.
        3. Upload the contents of this repo (or drag-and-drop the extracted files) to your new repository on the main branch.
        4. Go to the Actions tab in the repository â€” GitHub Actions will run the workflows and produce artifacts.
        5. When finished, check the Actions run and download artifacts named 'crypto-exe' and 'crypto-apk'.

        Quick next steps (Option B - local builds):
        - Windows EXE (local):
          1. Install Python 3.10+ from python.org.
          2. Place the files in a folder on Windows.
          3. Double-click build_exe.bat or run it from PowerShell. dist/crypto_4h_signal_app.exe will be created.
          4. Copy dist/crypto_4h_signal_app.exe to another Windows PC and run it (no Python required).

        - Android APK (local, advanced; recommended using WSL/Ubuntu or a Linux VPS):
          1. Use Ubuntu/WSL or a Linux machine and install Buildozer and dependencies.
          2. cd android_app && buildozer android debug
          3. APK will appear in android_app/bin/ (debug APK). Transfer to your phone and install (enable Install unknown apps).

        Notes and safety:
        - APK here is debug build (not Play Store-signed). For Play Store release, you must sign with your own key.
        - This app is analysis-only. Don't use it for automated trading without rigorous safety checks.
        - If you'd like, I can create the GitHub repo structure for you (I will provide the exact files here). I cannot push to your GitHub account from this chat.

        If you want me to prepare the ZIP as a direct downloadable file now, I already created it and the link is below.
